# WebScraping
Web Scraping Tool â€“ SQLite Database Overview This Python script scrapes paragraph text (

) from a target website and stores it in an SQLite database (scraped_data.db). It includes error handling, data validation, and retrieval functions to ensure smooth execution.

Features âœ… Scrapes text content from a website.

âœ… Stores extracted data in an SQLite database.

âœ… Implements error handling for connection failures.

âœ… Retrieves and displays saved data from the database.

âœ… Tracks execution time for efficiency.

âœ… View the database directly in VS Code.

Prerequisites Before running the script, install the required dependencies:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4

Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.

How to Run the Script

Open VS Code & Navigate to Your Project
Open VS Code (or any terminal).

Use the terminal to navigate to the directory where your script is saved:

cd path/to/your/script

Run the Script Execute the script using:
python scraper.py

Expected Output Once the script runs successfully, you should see:

A message indicating successful data extraction.

The number of extracted paragraphs.

A new database file, scraped_data.db, created in the project folder.

Sample extracted data displayed in the terminal.

The execution time printed at the end.

How to View the Database Method 1: Using SQLite Viewer in VS Code

Install SQLite Viewer Extension

Open VS Code.

Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X).

Search for "SQLite Viewer".

Install the extension by Alex Covizzi.

Open the Database in VS Code

Go to the Explorer panel.

Right-click on scraped_data.db.

Select "Open Database" from the context menu.

Click on the "Browse" tab to view stored data.

Method 2: Using SQLite Command Line

Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory: cd path/to/your/script

Open the SQLite database: sqlite3 scraped_data.db

View stored data with: SELECT * FROM scraped_content LIMIT 10;

Method 3: Using DB Browser for SQLite

Download and install DB Browser for SQLite.

Open scraped_data.db in the browser.

Navigate to the "Browse Data" tab to see stored content.

Troubleshooting ðŸ”¹ Issue: "Database file not created."

Solution: Ensure you have write permissions in the project folder.

ðŸ”¹ Issue: "No data found in the database."

Solution: The website might not contain

tags, or it may require JavaScript to load content. Try scraping another website.

ðŸ”¹ Issue: "Failed to connect to the database."

Solution: Ensure that scraped_data.db exists in the directory and is not locked by another process.
